# Telegram Gamebot 
**Tried out a Telegram Gamebot tutorial from [freecodecamp][1]. It shows how to set up the dino runner game for Telegram, with high score sharing and inline queries, using node.js**


- Basically takes Chromium's T-Rex runner app from Github
- Uses the telegram-bot api to integrate the game to Telegram
